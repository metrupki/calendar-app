# calendar-app
A calendar application for university courses. I did this as a project for a university course. It takes automatically the courses from the university course catalogue. Then in the app you are able to search the courses and add them to the calender. The calender does not add the course if it overlaps with a previous selected course, which is shown visually in the calendar and a red box witht a notification pops up as well.
The color of the time-slots of the calendar always take a different color if a course gets added.
The function is only tailored for this specific website of the university for now.
