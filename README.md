# calendar-app
How the app works:
A calendar application for university courses. It automatically takes the courses from the university course catalogue and you are able to search them and add them to the calender. The calender does not add the course if it overlaps with a previous selected course, which is shown visually in the calendar and a red box with a notification pops up as well.
The color of the time-slots of the calendar always take a different color if a course gets added.

For now the function of the calendar is only tailored for the specific university website. The website currently doesn't exist anymore, so the code needs some adjustment in order to work with other input.
